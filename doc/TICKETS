- batch disjunctive normal form

- batch window does not refresh on batch rerun

- pretty printing for LF's so selected inputs from batch window are readable

- j2emacs does not work properly on Windows/cygwin
  --> packaging a lean binary distribution & make bundle available for
      TNO (mail of 25. Nov '11)

- history does not work properly
- and not properly saved in project file

Today:

- get ASR parsing for AlizE to work
  * + n-best lattices instead of best only
    > check with giacomo/heriberto, more general: check interface,
  * connect parser with Dialogue manager (heriberto) , or directly ASR??
  * Urbify the parser (Heriberto)
  * best-first parsing
- manage partiality for AlizE: return n-best chunks
- get conversion to FS to work

+ Exception catching during batch test?
+ better logging for generation in urbi system (log4j properties?)
+ log4j properties: see file components/dialogue-fst/start-dialogue-fst.sh
+ if there is additional material in the LF input window, there is NO parse
  error! (fixed: due to batch LFs parsing)
+ batch reload does not clean items
+ sorting results in wrong selection in main window and editor
+ *** FAILURE *** disappeared in batch result window
+ sorting for batch result window
